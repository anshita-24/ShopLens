## 📸 How It Works – Visual Product Search

### Step 1: Upload or Click a Picture  
> *"I found this cool product and want to buy similar items !"*  
📷 Upload or click a picture of any unknown item directly in the app.

### Step 2: Image Feature Extraction  
🔬 Our ML pipeline processes the image and extracts its visual features using pretrained models like ResNet or CNN variants. These features are then converted into vectors.

### Step 3: Find Similar Products  
🧠 Using cosine similarity, we match the vector against a dataset of Walmart products and retrieve the most visually similar items.

### Step 4: Visit Product Page  
🔗 Want to buy it? Click the result and get redirected to the official Walmart product page.
